# Every day is a learning day.

While i was working in my projects in react, i thought: "Why not study React Native and make a simple app to improove even more my skills?"
So, that is it! An app that uses external APIs to fetch data and show it on the screen. Basically, the idea is to create an app for other developers, where they can find job applications with APIs of the most used platforms in the world, such as indeed, linkedin and glassdoor.

● Develop visually appealing UI/UX designs;<br />
● Fetch data from an external API and integrate it;<br />
● Implement search & pagination functionality;<br />
● Create customAPI data fetching hooks;<br />
● Write clean, organized, and maintainable code with proper architecture;<br />
● Follow the best practices for React Native development.<br />


#### Unfortunately the API is free, and it has the rate limit for 1/second. For some reason, the API said i'm making more than 1 request per second, and i actually don't know why is that. I've done everything right and there is no fetch loop in my code... Well, the app is functional, and here are some printscreens of it! The parts that say "Something went wrong" is the parts that the API says that i'm making more than 1 request per second.


# How to start

npm install<br />
npm install -g expo-cli<br />
npm install expo-font axios react-native-dotenv<br />
expo-cli start --tunnel<br />
